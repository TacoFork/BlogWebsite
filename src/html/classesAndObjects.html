            <strong>Classes and Objects</strong>
            <br>
            First there was functional or top-down programming. All programs had a single entry point and worked their way down,
            line by line, to a single exit point. They could jump around with various routines and go-to statements but all
            code was basically one large file. And it got cumbersome.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Division of labor</strong>
            <br>
            Somehow the idea emerged that you could have a programmer develop code in units or blocks or what is now known as
            "classes". And these classes could be developed simultaneously and put together in a larger program. And re-used
            in other programs. And also tested independently. Once tested, they wouldn't have to be tested again.
            <br><br>
            <strong>What goes into a class</strong>
            <br>
            Each class should have one purpose. Maybe you need a Calendar class to display calendars and perform date arithmetic.
            Or an Invoice class to display/print an invoice and perform all the calculations. Or an Encryption class which can
            take some text or a file and return an encrypted version of each. Each class can be used to create objects.
            These will contain the data and any processing methods to fulfill the purpose of the class.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Differences between classes and objects</strong>
            <br>
            The class is the code that will be executed, the type of data to be saved and the way it interacts with other
            things. The object is a particular instance of the class.
            <br><br>
            <strong>What happens in Vegas (my class) stays in Vegas (my class)</strong>
            <br>
            Encapsulation is the idea that your class is a black box. When we say something is a black box, that means
            what goes inside the object doesn't matter to the user. You just need to interact with the class through its
            interface.
            <br><br>
            <strong>The interface I show the world</strong>
            <br>
            The interface is those methods which are publicly available for use by other programmers.
            <strong>Extending classes with inheritance</strong>
            <br>
            A more generalized class like "Animal" can be extended to a more specialized class like "Cow", "Bird", and
            "Fish". All the features of Animal are the same among different species. But cows, birds, and fish have their
            own specialized methods. One can give milk, the other can fly, and the last can swim. Finally, keep in mind that
            all cows are animals but not all animals are cow.
